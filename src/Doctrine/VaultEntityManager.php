/**
 * The vault's private entity manager (1.19.0, REQ-ARCH-001 rule 6; opt-in with `database.private_entity_manager: true`
 * until 2.0, where it becomes the only mode).
 *
 * Up to 1.18 the vault repositories and services wrote through the application's entity manager named by
 * `database.entity_manager` (default `default`): saving an item flushed every change the application had left pending
 * in that unit of work, a failed vault write closed it, and the vault reset it to recover. The vault now writes through a
 * **private** manager created on the connection, configuration (mapping, metadata cache, proxies, repository factory)
 * and event manager (table prefix, user mapping, host listeners) of that source manager. Its unit of work holds only
 * vault rows (and references of `user_class`): a vault flush never commits an application change, and a failed write
 * closes only this manager. The tables do not move. The connection is shared, so a transaction the application opened
 * around a vault call includes the vault's rows (its flushes then use savepoints).
 *
 * The object is a stable decorator (the repositories keep it); the wrapped manager is resolved on every call and
 * created again when:
 *
 * - it was closed (its own failed flush) or the source connection changed;
 * - a rollback (transaction or savepoint) undid rows it wrote inside a transaction of the application, so its identity
 *   map may describe rows that no longer exist ({@see PrivateEntityManagerMiddleware}; DBAL 4 only, with DBAL 3 the
 *   manager is only replaced at the next boundary). A rollback of a level it did not write in leaves it alone. A stale manager that still has
 *   scheduled inserts, updates or deletes is **kept** (replacing it would silently drop them) until that work is
 *   flushed or the next unit-of-work boundary;
 * - {@see reset()} ran: at every unit-of-work boundary ({@see VaultUnitOfWorkSubscriber}: start and end of the main
 *   request, of a Messenger message and of the outermost console command) and at `kernel.reset`. Changes still pending
 *   at that moment are dropped and logged as a warning (entity classes and counts, never a value).
 *
 * The SQL filters enabled on the source manager, with their parameters, are mirrored on the private manager on every
 * call, and a filter whose parameters changed is re-created, so a parameter the source no longer has never survives.
